/**
 * Refuse a commit that adds an unlisted file under `src/lib/extensions/`.
 *
 * That directory is not ordinary source. It is the one place the build substitutes at bundle time:
 * `EXTENSIONS_MODULE` makes `#extensions` resolve somewhere else entirely, and the committed
 * default is what every build in this repository uses instead. Issue #1139.
 *
 * So a file added beside the default is one of two things, and neither is casual. Either it is
 * contract surface, which needs the versioning and the coordinated change the extension contract
 * describes - or it is something an override build half-replaces, because the module behind
 * `#extensions` then comes from elsewhere while this file still comes from core, and the two
 * disagree about what the seam is.
 *
 * An **allowlist**, not a pattern, and deliberately so. A denylist fails silently and later:
 * someone adds a file in a year, no rule mentions it, and nothing says a word. An allowlist fails
 * closed - a new file is refused until somebody edits the list, which is exactly the moment the
 * decision is being made. The contract expects this directory to change rarely, so the cost is a
 * one-line edit at the point of a deliberate change.
 *
 * The ESLint rule in `eslint.config.js` is the other half of the same boundary and cannot cover
 * this one: lint sees imports, and a file nobody imports yet is still contract surface.
 *
 * `.gitignore` is not an option either. A trailing-slash pattern does not match a symlink of that
 * name, and an ignored path is still committable with `git add -f`. This inspects what is actually
 * staged, so `-f` makes no difference.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-extension-point.mjs <path>...
 *
 * Invoked by pre-commit with the staged paths under that directory. With no arguments it checks
 * every file currently in the directory, which is what the test uses.
