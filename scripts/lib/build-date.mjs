/**
 * The date stamped into every binary, as ISO yyyy-mm-dd in UTC.
 *
 * A date rather than a timestamp: it answers "roughly when did this come from?", and a
 * to-the-second value would make two builds of the same commit differ for no reader's benefit.
 *
 * **It is derived, not read off the clock, so that a build stays reproducible.** Stamping
 * `new Date()` meant two builds of the same commit on different days produced different bytes -
 * which quietly cost the project the ability to rebuild a published binary and compare it, the
 * check that distinguishes a benign difference from a tampered artifact. Three sources, in order:
 *
 * 1. **`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`**, the cross-ecosystem convention for exactly this. An explicit value
 *    wins, so a caller reproducing an old build can name its date.
 * 2. **The committer date of `HEAD`**, which makes every build of a given commit identical without
 *    anyone configuring anything - including the release jobs, which build from a checkout.
 * 3. **The wall clock**, only when neither is available: an exported tarball with no `.git` and no
 *    environment variable. Such a build is not reproducible, and nothing here can make it so.
 *
 * @param {object} [context] - Where to look. Every field defaults to this process's own.
 * @param {object} [context.env] - The environment to read `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` from.
 * @param {string} [context.cwd] - The checkout whose `HEAD` dates the build.
 * @param {number} [context.now] - The clock, in milliseconds since the epoch.
 * @param {(command: string, args: string[], options: object) => {status: number, stdout: string}} [context.run] -
 *     How to run git. Injectable for tests.
 *
 * @returns {string} The date, in UTC.
