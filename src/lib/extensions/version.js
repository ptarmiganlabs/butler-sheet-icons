 * later runs on - and with no override set the committed default matches by construction, so a
 * runtime assert would sit in every shipped binary guarding a condition that cannot occur there.
 *
 * Exported from here rather than written inline in `scripts/bundle.mjs` so that the comparison is
 * covered by the test suite: `scripts/` is outside Jest's `roots`.
 *
 * @param {object} description - The description exported by the extensions module being bundled.
 * @param {string} source - Where that module came from, for the error message.
 *
 * @returns {void} Nothing. Returns normally when the versions agree.
 *
 * @throws {Error} When the description targets a version other than {@link SEAM_VERSION}, so the
 *     build stops before esbuild runs rather than producing a binary that misreads its own
 *     extensions.
