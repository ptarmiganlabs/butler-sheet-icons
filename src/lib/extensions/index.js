/**
 * What this build contributes to the CLI beyond what core declares itself.
 *
 * This is the committed default, and it describes nothing: no commands, no options, no hooks. That
 * is a real, correct implementation of "there is nothing to add" rather than a placeholder - it is
 * what every build in this repository bundles, and what `npm test` exercises. A throw, a warning or
 * a `null` here would all mean the normal path is the untested one.
 *
 * A variant build replaces this module by pointing `EXTENSIONS_MODULE` at its own, which
 * `scripts/bundle.mjs` turns into an esbuild alias for the `#extensions` specifier. Nothing is
 * discovered at runtime: the module is chosen when the bundle is built, so it is compiled into the
 * binary or it is not present at all. See issue #1135.
 *
 * The shape is documented as `SeamDescription` in `apply.js`, which is the only consumer.
 *
 * @type {import('./apply.js').SeamDescription}
